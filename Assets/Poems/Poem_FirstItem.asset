  Lines:
  - After a long flight, the crow returned with riches in his claws,
  - "certain this would earn him a moment\u2019s pause."
  - But after just a short moment of rest,
  - the goddess addressed her honoured guest.
  - "\u201CYou must go out and search in my stead again\u201D"
  - On her face an expression of regret and pain.
  - "\u201CAnything for you, my goddess\u201D the crow said"
  - Flying out again after bowing his head.
