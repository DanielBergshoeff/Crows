  Lines:
  - Once upon a midnight dreary,
  - a crow went to visit the goddess Mary.
  - The goddess looked down from her shiny throne,
  - at the crow, standing there all alone.
  - "\u201CMay I sit for just a little while?\u201D "
  - "\u201CI\u2019ve been flying for many a mile\u201D"
  - But the goddess shook her head,
  - And her voice then filled the crow with dread.
  - "\u201CYou may have a moment at my side\u201D"
  - "\u201CBut only for an offering!\u201D she cried"
  - "\u201CAn offering of treasure, of beauty like mine\u201D"
  - "\u201CTake this magic, to lead you back to my shrine.\u201D"
