  - Once again, the crow came with treasure for her on the throne,
  - weathered and hungry and tired to its bones.
  - "\u201CWould thou be so kind as to tell me..\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhy is it that thou asketh us to search for thee?\u201D"
  - And the goddess saw the honesty in his eyes,
  - and felt sharing the truth would be wise.
  - "\u201CMany years ago, a kindred spirit came to me\u201D"
  - "\u201CAnd told me of a set of items. Made in three\u201D"
  - "\u201CItems that combined could rekindle life\u201D"
  - "\u201CItems that could undo the damage done by a knife\u201D"
  - "\u201CItems that could return my friends to me\u201D"
  - "\u201CItems that will finally set me free\u201D"
  - "\u201CBut they can only be found by the keenest of eyes\u201D"
  - "\u201COnly by an animal of the air, one that flies\u201D"
  - "\u201CSo I ask you to join me, to help my army grow\u201D"
  - "\u201CAnd maybe that\u2019ll do it.. just one more crow\u201D"
  - And so she sent him on his way once more,
  - as another member of another corps,
  - And as he left, she was surrounded by treasure alone,
  - and only the tears falling down her face were her own.
